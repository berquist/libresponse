[[https://travis-ci.com/github/berquist/libresponse][https://api.travis-ci.com/berquist/libresponse.svg?branch=master]]

A library for performing generalized molecular response calculations: it works on top of non-orthogonal orbitals with arbitrary operators.

The formulation used is given in [[https://chemrxiv.org/articles/A_First_Principles_Approach_for_Partitioning_Linear_Response_Properties_into_Additive_and_Cooperative_Contributions/5773968/1]["A First Principles Approach for Partitioning Linear Response Properties into Additive and Cooperative Contributions"]].

** Usage

*** Q-Chem

The official Q-Chem documentation is located at https://manual.q-chem.com/5.2/Ch11.S15.html.

*** Psi4

A plugin with build instructions is located at https://github.com/berquist/libresponse_psi4.

** Build

The installation requirements are
- CMake >= 3.0
- A reasonably modern C++ compiler. GCC at least as old as 6.x should work.
- A version of [[http://arma.sourceforge.net/][Armadillo]] that allows the project to compile.
- [Optional] [[http://www.doxygen.org/][Doxygen]] to build documentation.
