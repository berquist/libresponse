** Build

The installation requirements are
- CMake >= 2.8.5
- A reasonably modern C++ compiler. GCC at least as old as 6.x should work.
- A version of [[http://arma.sourceforge.net/][Armadillo]] that allows the project to compile.
- [Optional] [[http://www.doxygen.org/][Doxygen]] to build documentation.
